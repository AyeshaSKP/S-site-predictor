# S-site-predictor
# This is a reseerch project that has been carried out by me during my masters progamme at the University of of Manchester for my masters in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology degree .

# What is the S palmitolytaion site
# Why a new predictor is needed for this project
# How did I figure out which machine learning tool to create a new predictor
# How have I created a better predictor and tested it
